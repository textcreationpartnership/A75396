            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>An Anſwer BY AN ANABAPTIST TO THE <hi>Three Conſiderations</hi> &amp;c.</head>
            <p>YOU deſire, <hi>All your Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Brethren to Conſider, and then Anſwer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I have Conſider'd, but I cannot tell whether you ſuppoſe all <hi>Diſſenters</hi> are your Brethren, or that all are your Brethren who diſſent from you. If the firſt, It ſeems probable to me, that you have been either Educated in a ſtrange Soyl, or have forgotten your Brothers Dialect; ſo that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern, that you are any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe a <hi>Baptiſt</hi> then only in <hi>Maſquerade,</hi> and therefore am ſhy of owning the Relation: But if all that diſſent from you, muſt therefore be reckon'd your Brethren, then I am in that Number, and becauſe I think Mr <hi>Penn</hi> may not have ſo much leiſure as my ſelf at preſent to attend upon your Trifles, I intend to be in the firſt Rank of your Reſpondents.</p>
            <p>I conſider alſo that though you have propoſed but Three Conſiderations, yet you have bolted out a Mulitude of Queſtions, which adminiſter an occaſion for as many more to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted.</p>
            <p>To your firſt Queſtion, Then; <hi>What Validity or Security can any preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded or deſigned future New Law or Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter have, when we ſee ſo many of the preſent Laws we already have, may be, and are by the Diſpenſing Power Diſpenſed with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>So many of the preſent Laws</hi>— The Grievance then with you may lie rather in the Number, than in the Diſpenſing Power. His Majeſty might with your leave perhaps have diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with ſome Perſons, and ſome Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties too, but not with ſo many al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together.</p>
            <p>One would think by that you would not have Quarrel'd at the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:153801:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>Diſpenſing Fower, tho the Act for levying Twelve Pence a Week had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been Proſecuted, ſo as the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Pound a Month had been Levied, nor if the Conventicle Act had been Diſpenſed with, ſo as the Thirty fifth of <hi>Queen Elizabeth</hi> had been rigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly Executed.</p>
            <p>I cannot tell <hi>how many,</hi> but all the Laws that are Diſpenſed with, are <hi>Penal Laws</hi> of a like nature for mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters Eccleſiaſtical: Uniformity, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments, Oaths and Teſts are the Subject of them all. If this be your Grief, you muſt be either a Conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> or ſuch a ſtrange ſort of a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> as in my Forty Years Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation among them I have never met with.</p>
            <p>But to come more cloſe to your Queſtion, <hi>What Validity can a New Law have, ſeeing ſo many of theſe we have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy are Diſpenſed with?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer with a like Interrogation, I grant that the <hi>King</hi> may do what his Royal Pleaſure is with his own, Does it thereupon follow, that He may do ſo likewiſe with what is mine? If I acckowledge and thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept His Diſpenſing with a Penalty, to which I am Obnoxious, becauſe I take a Liberty in matters of meer Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which I am not allowed by <hi>Statute Laws,</hi> Is it of neceſſary conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence that I therein acknowledge He may alſo impoſe a Fine upon me for lawfully uſing a Liberty when gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to me by Law?</p>
            <p>Its hoped the deſigned <hi>New Charter</hi> for Repeal of ſuch <hi>Penal Laws</hi> as are inconſiſtant with the Doctrines of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> will according to <hi>His Majeſties Declaration,</hi> both maintain the <hi>National Religion,</hi> as it is now E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhed by Law, and provide for ſuch a <hi>Chriſtian Liberty</hi> as may ſet at Eaſe and Secure the Conſciences, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and Properties of all that will Live Soberly, Righteouſly and Godly in this preſent Age, whether they be Conformiſts or Non-conformiſts to the <hi>National Religion.</hi> And a Grant remains valid, tho a Penalty may be diſpenſed with.</p>
            <p>But what if the <hi>New Law</hi> ſhould have no more Validity or Security then theſe Old Ones that are Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with? The <hi>Diſſenters</hi> will yet be in ſo much a better Caſe by a New Law, as that they will then be Secur'd by Law, whereas till that be done, they are always ſubject to be Ruin'd under colour of Law. But why are you ſo Querulous at the Diſpenſing Power in this particular caſe wherein it is Exerciſed? The <hi>King</hi> declares his O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, <hi>That Conſcience ought not to be conſtrained, nor People forced in matters of meer Religion.</hi> This Principle is the ground of his Diſpenſation. Have you not lately obſerved, That divers Gentlemen, who being in Commiſſion would not Execute theſe <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> and were therefore for a ſeaſon laid aſide, are now returned again into their former Stations, with Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and the Love of their Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours? Have you not Read the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy for the <hi>Church of England</hi> with relation to the Spirit of Perſecution, for which ſhe is accuſed? How their former Errors are extenuated by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, <hi>pag.</hi> 4. That tho the Party (in Parliament) of the <hi>Church of England</hi> did not perform what had been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by ſome Leading Men to the
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:153801:3" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <hi>Diſſenters</hi> (in procuring them a Bill of Eaſe) yet there was little or nothing done againſt them for about Nine Years; but they had their <hi>Meetings</hi> al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as publickly &amp; as regularly as the <hi>Church of England</hi> had their <hi>Churches.</hi> Do you not remember a Vote of the <hi>Houſe of Commons</hi> in 1680. whereby it was Reſolved, <hi>That the Proſeeution of</hi> Proteſtant Diſſenters <hi>upon the</hi> Penal Laws <hi>was at that time Grievous to the Subject.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Shall the <hi>Juſtices</hi> that did not Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute theſe Laws gain Eſteem by it? Shall the <hi>Church of England</hi> excuſe her ſelf from the charge of Severity by her not Executing theſe Laws for Nine Years together? Shall the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons in Parliament</hi> Vote the Execution of them a Grievance? And may not the <hi>King</hi> extend his Compaſſion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his Diſſenting Subjects, and ſay <hi>They ſhall not be Executed?</hi> To make ſuch a ſignal Act of Grace the ground of a groundleſs Jealouſie, and cauſe of Contention, to ſay no worſe of it) is highly Diſingenuous, and diſcovers a very froward and perverſe Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition: But let us conſider your next knot of Queſtions.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Have we, or can we have any higher Power here in</hi> England <hi>then</hi> King, Lords <hi>and</hi> Commons <hi>in Parliament Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled? The Laws that are now Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with, and rendred uſeleſs, were they not made by that Power? Can your</hi> New Charter <hi>be made by any higher or other Power? Do you think there is any Tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal or Spiritual Power here in</hi> England <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Diſpenſing Power? And can you make it appear to us?</hi> To theſe Queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons you deſire Mr <hi>Penn</hi> would let his Brethren and you know his Mind honeſtly.</p>
            <p>In his ſtead I anſwer, We have no Law Makers, but <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> in Parliament Aſſembled, but yet we are in <hi>England,</hi> as well as in o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther parts of the World, under a <hi>Law to God,</hi> and thereby each Man is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to preſerve within his own Breaſt the Anſwer of a good Conſcience, from which no Law of <hi>King, Lords</hi> and <hi>Commons</hi> can abſolve him; and hence it is that we have many Fundamental Maximes of Law grounded upon the <hi>Law of God,</hi> and <hi>common Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind,</hi> as well reſpecting the <hi>Soveraigns Prerogative,</hi> as the <hi>Right of the Subject,</hi> not written in Acts of Parliament, but in their Nature ſo invariable, <hi>That</hi> (as our <hi>Lawyers</hi> tell us) <hi>Acts of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament made againſt them are void in themſelves.</hi> And if this Opinion be true, theſe Fundamental Maximes of Law, whether in Spirituals or Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porals, tho they may be for a ſeaſon by a particular. Act of Parliament in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted, they are not thereby vaca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but ſtill retained, and will at one time or other again diſcover their Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor. Acts not contradictory to theſe Fundamental Laws may be uſeful for a ſeaſon, but not having that innate Stabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity as Fundamental Maximes have, may afterwards become uſeleſs, impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and grievous to be put in Executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; hence thoſe common diſtinctions between <hi>Malum in ſe, &amp; malum prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitum.</hi> And ſubſeqent thereto, in many caſes a power or no power of Diſpenſing, That which is unlawful in it ſelf to be done, as <hi>Murther, Theft, Treſpaſs,</hi> and the like, cannot be made
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:153801:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>lawful by any Law or Diſpenſation whatſoever. That which is lawful in it ſelf, but becomes unlawful, becauſe prohibited by a particular Statute, may be Diſpenſed with, ſo as no particular Perſon be Damnified by that Diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, and not otherwiſe. Among the many Viciſſitudes of Succeſſion to the <hi>Crown,</hi> between the two Houſes of <hi>York</hi> and <hi>Laneaſter,</hi> Do you think there were no Laws in being, made in the Raign of a King of one of theſe Branches (in Fact) diſpens'd with by his Succeſſor of the other Branch, till they came to be Repealed in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? Were the <hi>Oathes of Fidelity and Obedience</hi> made to the Line Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted, required to be taken by all <hi>Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs,</hi> and other <hi>Officers</hi> Commiſſionated by the other Line which ſucceeded, until they were Repealed in Parliament? In the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious changes of the <hi>National Religion,</hi> between the Reigns of <hi>King Henry</hi> the the Eighth and <hi>Queen Elizabeth,</hi> were all Penalties impoſed by Laws reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religion, exacted without any Relax or Suſpenſion, till thoſe Laws were Abrogated in Parliament. In the firſt Year of <hi>King Henry</hi> the Fourth a whole Parliament held in the Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty firſt of <hi>Richard</hi> the Second was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed: In one of which Laws then made, divers Pains of Treaſon were ordained, whereby, as the Act of Repeal ſays, <hi>No Man did know how he ought to behave himſelf to Do, Speak or Say for doubt of ſuch Pain;</hi> and if that Law had been Religiouſly obſerved till the moment of its Repeal It could never have been repealed. In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Year of <hi>Richard</hi> the Third, a Statute made in the Firſt of the ſaid <hi>King</hi> was Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with by <hi>Proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Vaughans Rep.</hi> pag. 353.</note> Now I would gladly hear what cauſe my pretended Brother <hi>Baptiſt</hi> has to Quarrel at his preſent <hi>Majeſties</hi> gracious Diſpenſing with Laws inflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Temporal Penalties for Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Matters, and rendring them uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs for the preſent, in that reſpect only, till they can be Repealed in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. And wherein the exerciſe of this Diſpenſing Power has exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed what has been in Fact done by his <hi>Royal Predeceſſors,</hi> and admitted may be lawfully done by our greateſt <hi>Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers.</hi> But to proceed,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Shall your</hi> New Charter <hi>have a Penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty inſerted to be inflicted on the Infringers or Breakers of it or no?

Not three skips of a Lowſe: And if it hath a Penalty, Cannot any King by his Prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative and Authority Royal Diſpence with the Penalty? And what will it ſignifie then?</hi>

            <p>This pretended <hi>Baptiſt's</hi> Reſolution of the firſt of theſe Queſtions is as Weak as it is Idle, and both that and the others, may receive a ſatisfactory Anſwer.</p>
            <p>Such a <hi>New Charta</hi> as is deſired, if no Penalty be annex'd, may be very ſignificant in many reſpects, (1) It may be materially good and obliging to Obedience by its innate Vertue, on pain of Condemnation by the Divine Law; and in that reſpect of greater ſignification, and much more deſirable then ſuch Laws as are materially Bad, and cannot be obeyed without Breach of the <hi>Law of God.</hi> (2) This <hi>New
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:153801:4" rendition="simple:additions"/>Charter</hi> may, without annexing any Penalties, Repeal all thoſe Penalties, by which Perſons are compelled to perform Acts of Divine Worſhip, contrary to their Underſtanding, Faith, and a Good Conſcience, and put it out of the Power of any Diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to revive thoſe Laws, or to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe Penalties of the like kind. (3) Such a <hi>New Law</hi> may without any Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties by its ſimple Declarations put an iſſue to that, which is now unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably made the ground of all our Conteſts, and confirm to us all thoſe Laws by which our Liberties and Properties are preſerved.</p>
            <p>But preſuming it may alſo have Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties inſerted to be inflicted on the Infringers or Breakers of it, Theſe may be ſo qualified as not to be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſed with; (if under the colour thereof evil minded Men do not prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice upon the Soveraign Power: For in ſuch a caſe, if the Soveraign Power cannot Diſpence with the Penalty of a <hi>Statute Law,</hi> it may be diveſted of ſuch means as are neceſſary for its own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, (but in any ordinary caſe, if any Perſon or Body Corporate receive particular Damage by the breach of ſuch a <hi>New Law,</hi> He or They may if the Legiſlators pleaſe, be Intitled to a particular Action by the ſame Law, and recover Damages againſt the Breakers of it,<note place="margin">

            <p>The Inſtance you give, to put us out of Doubt, in Mr <hi>Langhornes</hi> Words, touching the <hi>Kings</hi> Right in Diſpenſing with <hi>Penal Laws,</hi> I ſhall not Repeat, but only obſerve, That the Opinion you cite (however you may do it in ſcorn) carries ſuch an Evidence in it for a Diſpenſing Power (not in ordinary Caſes, as that Author has well obſerved) but upon extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occaſions, when the <hi>King</hi> in his Wiſdom ſhall find it neceſſary, as calls for more Cunning then I yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in you, to raiſe any material Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection againſt it.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>Now where is the aſſurance then of Mr</hi> Penn's <hi>New Charter?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Our Aſſurance will lie not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Authority of the Legiſlators, equal to any other Law, but alſo in the Authority of the Matter, which will command an Aſſent in every Mans Conſcience aſſoon as he reads it, <hi>Not to do that to another, which he would not have done to himſelf.</hi> Our Aſſurance will be in our Love and Affection One towards Another, as Neighbours con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd to promote the common Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of the Realm. In the Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs of all Parties againſt any one particular Faction, if any ſuch ſhould riſe up, and attempt to inthrall the Conſciences of all the reſt, in our thankful and dutiful Behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards our Soveraign for breaking off thoſe intolerable Yoaks we could not bear, and ſetting us upon ſuch a laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Foundation, both for our Civil and Religious Liberties, as with a diſcreet Care and Management of them may remain firm to Perpetuity.</p>
            <p>Qu. <hi>But who can tell what King we
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:153801:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>may have after our preſent</hi> Soveraign <hi>whether ſo mercifull, or ſo juſt? Or what</hi> Skeriffs <hi>the next</hi> King <hi>may choſe, and what Returns of</hi> Parliament Men <hi>they may make? For you know the Forfeiture on the</hi> Sheriffs <hi>making a falſe Return is no great matter, and cannot a</hi> King <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don it by his Diſpenſing Power or Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity Royal? What will, nay what can your new</hi> Charter <hi>then ſignifie, when it either is or may be, (according to your own Doctrin) Invalidated, Diſanulled, or Annihilated in an inſtant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> If there ſhould be raiſed by my Quereſt, or any other like him, ſuch a perverſe Spirit and behaviour in any Party of Men, as to prevent the Nations ſelted enjoyment of theſe Priviledges we now have as Men and Chriſtians, by his Majeſties Prudence, Juſtice and Clemency, who can tell (indeed) what the ſad Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of it may be? But if Duty, Reaſon and common Intereſt prevail, here is nothing offer'd that ſhould cauſe any Man to ſlack his utmoſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence and endeavours to arrive at the Settlement propoſed by a <hi>New Charter.</hi> For what do theſe Queries tend to, or what of any weight do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain? For,</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Does</hi> William Penn, <hi>or any party of</hi> Diſſenters <hi>propoſe any ſuch Methods to be perſued, as may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance Prerogative to that degree, as to Invalidate, or Annihilate all our Laws?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Is not the National Religion, as it is Stiled in the firſt place to be maintained, and as well ſecured, as any old or new Law can make it, with ſuch a Liberty for conſiencious</hi> Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters <hi>from it in the worſhip of God (Exploding of all Liſenciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs) as may free them front future inconveniency upon account of Religion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>Is any thing ſuggeſſed that by a</hi> new Charter, <hi>greater power ſhould be given to the King for chooſing of</hi> Sheriffs, <hi>then now he has, or that the penalties upon a</hi> Sheriffs <hi>making falſe Returns, ſhall be leſs then now then are? or any thing elſe to render our Caſe worſe then it is.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>You take it for granted, <hi>I know,</hi> that which I do not know, nor your ſelf neither, as I ſuppoſe, that the <hi>Sheriffs</hi> Forfeiture, who ſhall make a falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn is no great matter, or that which the <hi>King</hi> can pardon, or diſpence with. The Caſe of Sr <hi>Samuel Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nardiſton</hi> wherein he had a Verdict and Eight Hundred Pounds damage given againſt a <hi>Sheriff</hi> for a falſe Return, may inform you otherwiſe; and certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a <hi>new Charter</hi> will not make it leſs Penal then now it is, but if it ſhould ever happen, notwithſtanding a <hi>new Charter,</hi> as it has heretofore happen'd notwithſtanding our <hi>old Charter,</hi> that Knights and Burgeſſes ſhould not be duly choſen; the ſame Fate may at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend ſuch a Parliament, as did that of 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:153801:5" rendition="simple:additions"/>I now come to your ſecond Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, wherein you pray Mr <hi>Penn</hi> to conſider, <hi>What his</hi> New Charter <hi>can ſignifie, ſo long as there is a High Commiſſion Court, or a high Commiſſion for Eccleſiaſtical Affairs ſet up? Cannot thoſe Commiſſioners take any of your and our Preachers, Teachers, or Miniſters to Task when they pleaſe? Cannot they, when they have a mind to it, ſuſpend Mr</hi> Pen, <hi>or</hi> George Whitehead, <hi>Mr</hi> Alſop, <hi>Mr</hi> Lobb, <hi>Mr</hi> Mead, <hi>or Mr</hi> Bowyer, <hi>as well as the</hi> Biſhop of London, <hi>&amp;c. Cannot the Court when they will, or ſhall think fit, or be commanded, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, ſilence or forbid any or all the Diſſenting Miniſters to Preach any longer in their Meetings, if they will not Read any Declaration or Order whatever, that the King ſhall ſet forth and require them to Read? Remember the</hi> Magdalen Colledge Men; <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member alſo that Sawſe for a</hi> Gooſe <hi>is or may be Sawſe for a</hi> Gander.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> The caſe of <hi>Magdalen Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is publiſhed at large, you may Read it if you pleaſe, and Anſwer it if you can, eſpecially the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel caſe in <hi>Edwards</hi> the Sixth time. But pray what is that to a <hi>New Charter?</hi> If wrong Judgment was given by the Court (as you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſuppoſe) in that caſe, do you make no diſſerence between Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſing with a Law, and wrong Judgment given againſt a Law (if any ſuch ſhould be) in <hi>Weſtminſter Hall</hi> or the <hi>Eccleſiaſtical Court</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> you name, or you who pretend to be a <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> be of the <hi>Clergy of England</hi> in the Eye of the Law, and hold Eccleſiaſtical Affairs and Benefits, they or you may for Miſ-behaviour be ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from them by the Eccleſiaſtical Commiſſioners. But why do you fancy that a <hi>New Charter</hi> (by which it is expected that Penalties for matters of meer Religion will be repealed) ſhould be made to ſignifie nothing, by the Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Commiſſioners which now are; I can eaſily fore-ſee that a <hi>New Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> may make that Commiſſion in the caſes you mention to ſignifie nothing; but I cannot imagine how that Commiſſion ſhould make a <hi>New Charter</hi> inſignificant. As to the ſilencing of Diſſenting Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, its evident as the Law now is, their reading or not reading the <hi>Kings Declaration</hi> in their Meetings will not prevent it, if the King with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his Favour, nor is there any cauſe to give the Eccleſiaſtical Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners any trouble about them; for as the Laws now are there are other Eccleſiaſtical Courts, which with the aid of the Juſtices at their Seſſions are ſufficiently impowred to Cenſure, Fine, Impriſon, Baniſh or Hang them for their Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Religion Eſtabliſhed by Law.</p>
            <p>You exhort us <hi>to ſee before we Leap, whether the Words in the Orders ſet forth in the</hi> Gazett, <hi>for contempt of his Majeſties Authority will run no further then juſt Mr</hi> Penn <hi>will have it.</hi> And ask, <hi>Can he ſtop the Current of it
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:153801:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>when he pleaſes?</hi> and ſay, <hi>If he could, we are not ſure he would; for formerly he had no great kindneſs (we know) for us</hi> Baptiſts <hi>and other</hi> Diſſenters, <hi>and if he could and would we are not ſure of his Life, how long; therefore it will be the greateſt piece of Weakneſs and Folly in the World for us to Danee af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his and the Jeſuits Pipe alone, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary both to all common Sence and Reaſon, and our own general Intereſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> How do you make out your Inference, <hi>That to do as you ſay is the greateſt piece of Weakneſs and Folly?</hi> I take it to be altogether as great folly to Dance after your Pipe in Company, contrary to common Sence, Reaſon and Intereſt, as af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Mr <hi>Penn</hi> and the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> alone; ſurely in this you take the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> to be very forgetful of what their Senſes ſo lately teſtified, when un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the feeling Proſecution of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Laws,</hi> and to be unreaſonably ignorant of their Intereſt in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring thoſe <hi>Penal Laws</hi> may be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed in Parliament, and a due <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> Eſtabliſhed in their room. But for what cauſe do you reflect upon Mr <hi>Penn?</hi> I take it as a certain Evidence, that all Pamphlets on this Subject, that are interlaced with perſonal Reflections aſſerted on Surmiſes, without proof, are deſigned to promote Factious Diſſentions, rather then to Unite in one common Intereſt, and heal our uncharitable Diviſions. I have known Mr <hi>Penn</hi> for many Years, and have been credibly informed by others, that from his Age of Seventeen Years he has been an inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate Aſſociate with the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent of <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> that when he was of <hi>Chriſt Church Colledge</hi> in <hi>Oxford,</hi> he was fined for his diſſent from the Religious Ceremonies of the Colledge: He ſuffered many Hardſhips in his Fathers Family on that account, has been a conſtant Advocate theſe Twenty Years for the Liberty we enjoy and hope to to have confirm'd: I have heard of many good Offices he has done at Court, both for <hi>Diſſenters</hi> and <hi>Conformiſts;</hi> &amp; that he has improved that Favour which has been ſhewn him by his Prince, both before and ſince his Aſcending to the Throne, for the Benefit and not to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of others: I have not known of any rich Preſents or Rewards that have been given or required for any of his Services, or any Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments he ſeeks or accepts of. How his pleadings for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience</hi> has or can tend to the improvement of his Revenues, I cannot apprehend neither; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you will free your ſelf from the ſuſpition of an ill De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, and a groundleſs Aſperſion, tho Mr <hi>Penn</hi> may be no Friend to ſuch pretended <hi>Baptiſts</hi> and nominal <hi>Diſſenters</hi> as you are; its incumbent on you to ſhew wherein he has ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted that he had formerly no great Kindneſs for thoſe that are really ſuch upon this account.</p>
            <p>I paſs by your trifling about the enlarging or limiting Authority by the power or will, length or ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Mr <hi>Penn</hi>'s Life, and proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:153801:6" rendition="simple:additions"/>Thirdly, <hi>To conſider above all what Security or Validity this</hi> New Charter <hi>can be of, when there is a ſtanding Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my kept on Foot? Whether</hi> Guns <hi>will hear Reaſon, or</hi> Dragoons <hi>mind Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Arguments? your reference to their practice in</hi> France, <hi>if we are not ſtrangely Infatuated and given up to Ruin and Deſtruction; your Query whether their Carriage and Quartering will agree with a</hi> New Charter <hi>for Liberty, and if Mr</hi> Penn <hi>be a Friend to Liberty for Liberties ſake, you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire an honeſt, clear nnd ſatisfactory Anſwer to theſe Three Points.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Mr <hi>Penn</hi>'s ſtead give me leave at preſent to return you an anſwer, by asking you ſome Queſtions; Is the <hi>Weſtern Rebellion,</hi> ſlipt out of your mind? Was there no occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on given for multiplying <hi>Dragoons?</hi> Is <hi>Soveraign Power</hi> ſo limited by our Laws, as that it cannot make uſe of ſuch means as are of apparent and abſolute neceſſity for its own preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation? Did you ever know of any <hi>Army</hi> wherein no diſſorders were committed in their Marches, or Quarterings? Are our <hi>Dragoons</hi> without any diſcipline, for reform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or puniſhing abuſes when they are complained of?</p>
            <p>Do you, and ſuch as follow your Examples, take a right courſe to avoid ſuch miſchiefs, being done in <hi>England</hi> by <hi>Dragoons,</hi> as are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in <hi>France?</hi> I am as far from defending any of their diſorders, or deſiring their continuance longer then needs muſt, as I am from belei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving you to be a <hi>Baptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But ſure I am, whatever you are, your Reaſonings are very unſavory, and unſafe, tending to faſten us un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that Bondage, you ſeemingly adviſe us to avoid; for to deal plainly and honeſtly with you, (as you deſire Mr <hi>Penn</hi> to do) I ſee no way to eſcape the diſſorders that are either felt or feared, but by gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving His <hi>Majeſty</hi> full ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, not only of our Fidelity, but of our Affection alſo to his Perſon and Government, in complying with what he ſhall propoſe, for maintenance of the <hi>National Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> and all the poſſeſſions of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> as Eſtabliſhed by Law, and aboliſhing all ſuch Penalties for Non-conformity to the <hi>National Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,</hi> as may be found inconſiſtent with the common Right and Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of <hi>Mankind,</hi> Doctrines of <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity</hi> and Intereſt of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall now conſider your cloſing points (1) <hi>In the mean time it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to be highly the Duty of all Men as well Diſſenters as others, who have Votes in chooſing Parliament-Men, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all to chooſe ſuch Faithful Patriots as will take care of theſe things already hinted, and others that may be brought before them; that our Liberties, our Laws, and our Lives may be preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from ill deſigning Men, and from fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> Quo Warranto's, <hi>and all the high Violaters and Infringers thereof called to accompt, and juſtly puniſhed; this will well become them, and ſecure us, more then any titular Charter what ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>

            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:153801:7" rendition="simple:additions"/>If you had only adviſed the chooſing Faithful Patriots for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament-Men, without cutting out their Work, your advice might have been ſound; or if you had on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly looked forwards that our Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and our Lives might be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ill deſigning Men; and our Laws ſo ſettled, that all good Subjects may equally ſhare in the benefit of them; your Advice might have been ſeaſonable; for it is evident that our Circumſtances require as wiſe and moderate Men, experienced in civil and Religious affairs, as every <hi>Parliament</hi> in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> did; and if the Nation be bleſs'd with ſuch a Choice in the next <hi>Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament,</hi> all ſober perſons, may by their wiſe Councels be out of fear of ſuffering Prejudice by future ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents of State: But at this juncture to talk of calling to an Accompt, and puniſhing all ſuch as you may reckon high Violaters and Infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of our Laws and Liberties is very unſeaſonable: Pray tell us ſince you undertake to Chalk out the way for a <hi>Parliament,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the Work you would have done by them, how far they are to look back, and where and with what ſort of Men you would have them begin; with ſuch of the <hi>Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> or of the <hi>Lawyers,</hi> as were the firſt Advancers of Prerogative a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove your meaſures; or with the <hi>Diſſenters</hi> for thankfully accepting the <hi>Kings Indulgence,</hi> and making uſe of the Liberty he has been plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to grant in their peaceable and Religious Aſſemblies? after ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Convulſions in the State, Plots and Counter-plots as we have known in our Age. The ſame things to be liable to Penalties at one ſeaſon, which at another time have been marks of the greateſt Loyalty; ſober Men cannot but think it is high time to adhere to, and perſue thoſe Royal Methods, that have been with good ſucceſs begun, and are propoſed to be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled on terms of laſting ſecurity and Peace.</p>

               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> I like it as part of Holy writ, Teaching me (1) Not to abuſe that Liberty whereunto I am called by the Goſpel, (2) To prize that Liberty in the Goſpel which is indulged me by my <hi>Soveraign</hi> and to promote what in me lyes, the Eſtabliſhing of it by a <hi>New Charter</hi> (3) Not to hearken to you, or any, which perhaps did never feel the want of this Liberty, and would miſguide me, and take an Occaſion to deceive me of it, by talking of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of another Sort which ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie nothing to me or any other Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> if we be depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of this (4) as inducing me (for the better underſtanding of the Text you cite) to conſider the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>text by which I am caution'd not to hearken to any ſuch, as promiſe me Liberty, who are themſelves <hi>overcome by, and in Bondage to their own Fleſhly poluting Luſts,</hi> (5) as inſtructing me by certain Characters to diſcern what ſort of Perſons they are who (by enticing Words) would beguile me of my Liberty; chiefly ſuch as deſpiſe Government, are Preſumptious, and not afraid to ſpeak <hi>Evil</hi> of Dignities: And with this ſhort Paraphraſe, I may after your Example, ask, <hi>How do You; Or how will you like that word?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this I agree with what you ſay, <hi>The Name of Liberty ſignifies nothing without the Subſtance.
